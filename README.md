# Wikipedia_Admin_Voting

This project was done together with Andres Virguez (andresvBSE) for a Networks class project during a Masters in Data Science for Decision Making project at BSE.

The project entails an analysis of the Stanford Wikipedia Admin voting dataset for any key players, reciprocity and peer effects beyond an initial descriptive analysis. The Stanford data can be found at https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-RfA.html
